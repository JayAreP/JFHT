# Jar's floating healspam text. 

Don't @ me, I like to see floating numbers when I heal. 

## Install  

Just install it the same as any other WoW addon. 

## What it do?

Produces 4 movable anchors. 2 for direct heals, and 2 for periodic heals. 

Put them whever you want! I won't judge. (Anywhere...)

Heals are automatically assigned to one or the other depending on the spell ID. (Odds go to 1, evens go to 2). At some point I'll make this configurable. 

When a target recieves a heal of yours, it will generate some floating text over one of the anchors. 

You can adjust the number of unique heal "streams" to keep the massive amounts of text seperated. You can also adjust how long before the text fades, and how fast it scrolls up.
